                Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)<br>
            On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)</br>
        New girl moved on the block (on the block)<br>
    She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)<br>
Last night I slept over hers (over hers)<br>
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)<br>
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na<br>
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa<br>
Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash<br>
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass<br>
A real ninja with the blade and the mask<br>
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks<br>
Now she tryna patch me up, but<br>
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust<br>
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol<br>
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude<br>
The blinds wide open so he can<br>
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'<br>
Think about it, fresh out the shower<br>
You touch yourself after hours<br>
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom<br>
You're sleeping alone in your bed<br>
But check your window, he's at your window<br>
The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites<br>
I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right<br>
You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight<br>
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight<br>
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck<br>
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one<br>
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want<br>
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy<br>
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front<br>
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we<br>
We as including I and yourself, making three<br>
Little ones ? pretty hard if you ask me<br>
You're a pretty broad in the top three<br>
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so<br>
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then<br>
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time<br>
The blinds wide open so he can<br>
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'<br>
Think about it, fresh out the shower<br>
You touch yourself after hours<br>
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom<br>
You're sleeping alone in your bed<br>
But check your window, he's at your window<br>
One, two, you're the girl that I want<br>
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit<br>
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this<br>
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous<br>
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous<br>
I just wanna drag you're lifeless body to the forest<br>
And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with<br>
You cunt<br>
I just wanna talk, and conversate<br>
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate<br>
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date<br>
So just say yes, let the future fall into place<br>
I just wanna talk, and conversate<br>

And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date<br>
